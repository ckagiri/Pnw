The predictions will be determined at the end of normal match play (90 Mins + extra time). 
For competitions that have knock-out stages, penalty results are not considered when calculating the points scored.

Prediction Deadlines:
Your prediction for a match must have been recorded no later than the scheduled start date/time of that match and any prediction 
entered after that time will be disregarded. You may predict a score of between '0' and '9' for each team for a given match and you 
may update your score prediction as many times as you wish up to the scheduled start date/time of a match. 
At the start date/time of a match your most recently saved prediction shall be deemed to be your prediction for that match.
